# basic_EDA

In this notebook I use zomato dataset to carry out basic Exploratory Data Analysis. The main goal is to get insights from the dataset with visualizations rather
than build any model with it. Some analysis done are the following:

* Explore the basic descriptive statistics
* Checking for missing values
* Checking for duplicates
* Answering question such as:
  * Top ten cuisines
  * Number of restaurants with online delivery
  * What is the percentage of non rated transacctions for restaurants with and without online delivery?
  * Percentage of resturants with different ratings...
